Internet of Things (IoT) is new trend. Researchers need IoT data for their analysis. Most of IoT data generators publically available are web based/cloud based and providing limited functionality. Functionality extension facility is difficult in existing IoT data generators because of their codes are not public. 

“IoT Advanced Data Generator” allows users to create complete IoT use case on single machine with traffic capturing ability on same machine. Compromised IoT device is new concept provided by IoT Advanced Data Generator, which is missing in existing IoT data generators. Also New protocols/functionality can easily be added in IoT Advanced Data Generator. User can create use cases and add devices in those uses cases with different IP.  Complete network traffic can be logged using wire shark on same machine.
